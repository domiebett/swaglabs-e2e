# Swaglabs End-to-End Testing Framework

![Build Status](https://github.com/domiebett/swaglabs-e2e/actions/workflows/e2e.yml/badge.svg)

This project is an end-to-end testing framework written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and TypeScript. It is designed to automate the testing of the Swaglabs application to satisfy the following requirements:

In this section, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your skills in automated testing. Your task is to create a new framework from scratch, following best practices for automated test framework development. At Ceros, we primarily use TypeScript and Playwright and would like you to follow a similar setup. However, you are welcome to choose a different framework if you can explain the benefits of your choice.

Once you have completed the development of the test automation framework, we would like you to write a few tests against https://www.saucedemo.com:

List of tests cases we would like you to automate:

- [x] Verify the standard user can log in (credentials found on the SwagLabs login page).
- [x] Verify you can add an item to the cart and that itâ€™s visible on the cart page.
- [x] Verify that, by default, the inventory page lists 6 items.

Bonus Automation Challenges:

- [x] Verify you can sort the inventory items by price, high-to-low, and the sorting is correct.
- [x] Ensure you can sort the inventory by name, Z-to-A, and the sorting is correct.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (version 6.x or higher) or yarn (version 1.x or higher)

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swaglabs-e2e.git
   cd swaglabs-e2e
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. Install required browser binaries

   ```sh
   npx playwright install
   ```
   
3. Create a `.env` file and copy the contents of `.env.example` into it:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Fill in the appropriate variables in the `.env` file. (Values found on the [SwagLabs login page](https://www.saucedemo.com) ):
   - `STANDARD_USERNAME`: The username for logging into the application
   - `STANDARD_PASSWORD`: The password for logging into the application

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
npx playwright test
```

This will execute all the tests in the `e2e/tests` directory. If you'd only like to run the smoke tests, I have included `@smoke` tag which can be run as follows:

```sh
npx playwright test --grep @smoke
```

## Continuous Integration (CI) Implementation

The project uses GitHub Actions to run end-to-end tests automatically on each push or pull request to the `main` branch. The CI workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` file. It performs these actions:

1. Run end-to-end tests using Playwright.
2. Upload the Playwright HTML report as an artifact.

Additionally, the workflow deploys the Playwright report to GitHub Pages for easy access.

## HTML Test Reports

The HTML test reports generated by Playwright are automatically published to GitHub Pages. You can access the latest test reports at the following URL:

## FAQs

### 1. Why are my playwright tests failing?

After installing all dependencies, make sure you have added the credentials in the .env file. You need to:
- Create a `.env` file.
- Copy the `.env.example`.
- Update the values for `STANDARD_USERNAME` and `STANDARD_PASSWORD` with the username and password for the standard user found on the [SwagLabs login page](https://www.saucedemo.com)

### 2. How do i run smoke tests?

You can run smoke tests using the command:

```sh
npx playwright test --grep @smoke
```

### 3. Where can i find execution reports:

The latest test reports are published at: [https://domiebett.github.io/swaglabs-e2e/](https://domiebett.github.io/swaglabs-e2e/)

### 4. How do I run tests in headed mode (with a visible browser)?

```sh
npx playwright test --headed
```
